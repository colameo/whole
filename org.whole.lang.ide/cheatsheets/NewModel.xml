			"Click to Skip" button.

			and choose Whole-&gt;Whole Project in the list.

			HelloWorld model.
			You may do this by either clicking the "Click to Perform" button below
		    to launch the New Java Class wizard, or you may use the Eclipse tools to
			do it, by using the File-&gt;New-&gt;Whole Model action. When you
			use the wizard, make sure that you specify the Language of your choice.
