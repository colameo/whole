7. Disclosure of IP Rights
During the thirty (30) days period immediately following the date that SWIFTStandards are provided to you, you may disclose that the publication of, use of or compliance with SWIFTStandards as presented, in whole or in part, would infringe any of your IP Rights. Upon timely disclosure and considering the non-commercial nature of SWIFTStandards, you agree to license any such IP Right to SWIFT (including the right to grant sub-licenses) on royalty-free or otherwise reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and solely for the purpose of developing, implementing, promoting and using SWIFTStandards.

Any non-disclosure of your IP Rights pursuant to Section 7 of this License Agreement, shall be considered as a final and irrevocable waiver to assert or enforce any such IP Right that you may own or control, against SWIFT or any other third party that may use SWIFTStandards, if the allegedly infringing activity is caused solely by the use of SWIFTStandards in accordance with this License Agreement.

SWIFTStandards are provided "as is". SWIFT makes no express or implied representations, including but not limited to, warranties of merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose nor any warranty that the use of SWIFTStandards will not infringe any third party IP Rights.
